#  🍕 8 Week SQL Challenge

This repository contains the solution for the 8 case studies in #8WeekSQLChallenge!
I started this challenge for practicing SQL and HERE I am with Case Studies I have completed so far. I enjoyed doing this, it obviously requires a good effort and you have to be patient whenever you get stuck.This exercise is full of learning, Each question makes you brainstorm.

### 📌Business Task 
Danny is expanding his new Pizza Empire and at the same time, he wants to Uberize it, so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.
